subtitle: 'Nuccio & Gandolfo'
short_bio: "Nuccio and Gandolfo are dear friends and colleagues and are the backbone of Hidden Italy in Sicily. Both were born, raised and live in a small town in the centre of Sicily which is the base for the first part of Hidden Italy guided tours in May. As drivers of the two tour minibuses they accompany us throughout the Sicily guided tours but they are much more than this: they are fine examples of Sicilian grace and hospitality; Nuccio's picnics during the tour are legendary; while the visit to Gandolfo's family home in the country outside the town (a 19th century former baronial home built into the side of a cliff) is often considered one of the highlights of the trip. Nuccio also provides the transfers and back-up on the Sicily self-guided walk."
