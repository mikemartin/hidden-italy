subtitle: 'Friuli Guide'
short_bio: "Antonio joins us on the second leg of the Trieste and Friuli tour. Born near Venice, Antonio moved to his wife's family village in the Natisone valleys on the border with Italy and Slovenia some years ago and has embraced his new home with passion. Antonio joins us on what must be one of the most extraordinary Hidden Italy walks: following the ridge line that has formed a border, for better or worse, between the Latin and Slavic worlds since Roman times, including most recently as a part of the Iron Curtain and as a bloody frontline in World War I. Antonio unlocks its secrets and stories with an encyclopedic knowledge and narrative flair that rivals Ken Follett."
