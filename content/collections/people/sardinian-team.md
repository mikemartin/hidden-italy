subtitle: 'Fabrizio & Maria-Giovanna'
short_bio: "Fabrizio is our man in the Barbagia, in central Sardinia. He fell in love with the mountains when, as a kid, he spent his summers with his uncle grazing in the high pastures. He's been exploring the mountains ever since. He is a passionate guide, an accomplished photographer and plays a mean piano-accordion. Maria-Giovanna was also born in Oliena. She spent five years on the 'Continent', studying law in Bologna and working in Rome but her love for her native land drew her back to Sardinia. Their good friend Antonio is a 'pastore' (a shepherd) who hosts us on his property, providing a wonderful BBQ lunch of homegrown suckling pig, accompanied by his own oil, bread, red wine and garden grown tomatoes."
