title: 'The Puglia Team'
subtitle: 'Silvia & Marco'
short_bio: 'Silvia and Marco are our captains courageous in southern Puglia, taking us out on their two 12-metre yachts for a day exploring the sparkling waters and rocky coastline of southern Puglia. They are both proud Salentini (inhabitants of the Salento, the tip of the heel of Puglia) and they bring to life the history and traditions of their native region. A highlight of the day is the picnic lunch on board - all rigorously local produce, of course.'
