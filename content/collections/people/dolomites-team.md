subtitle: 'Sonia & Alfred'
short_bio: "Sonia and Alfred's families have lived in the Val Badia in the heart of the Dolomites for many generations (and Alfred seems to be related to everyone in the valley) and join us for our autumn tour of these beautiful mountains. They are very proud of their rich Ladino heritage, which traces its roots back to pre-Roman times (their children speak Ladino at home, attend school conducted in German and Italian and are learning English as a foreign language all before the age of 10!) and are pleased to share their stories and traditions, bringing to life the valleys and villages of their homeland."
