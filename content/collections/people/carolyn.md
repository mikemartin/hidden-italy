short_bio: 'Carolyn and Simon met at a presentation by the Director of the Uffizi Gallery at the Italian Institute of Culture in Sydney - it was love at first sight (at least for Simon, Carolyn took a little more convincing). At the time, Carolyn was working at the Banca Credito Italiano in Sydney. Her love affair with Italy had begun some years before in 1982 when she spent three months in Tuscany. Some time later she returned to Tuscany, working for three years on a wine and olive oil estate outside Vinci, 20 kilometres south of Florence. Carolyn is the backbone of Hidden Italy. She speaks fluent Italian (with a very good Tuscan accent) and has a passion for Italian textiles and furniture.'
