        text: "The largest island in the Mediterranean, Sicily is squeezed between Europe and Africa, between Christendom and Islam. It's a spectacular region with exceptional walks following country lanes, mountain trails and coastal paths. Sicily also boasts one of the finest, and surely the most diverse, cuisine in Italy based on their exceptional produce.\_ Truly, the perfect destination for an off-the-beaten track adventure."

        text: "There is not one but many different Sicily’s: the Baroque splendours and crowded markets of Palermo; the magnificent solitude of the island's Greek temples and theatres; the timelessness of forgotten villages scattered through the green interior; the glamour and bustle of Taormina; the dreamy mirage of the Aeolian islands and the power and majesty of Mt Etna."
