        text: "\_Visiting Puglia is an adventure.\_ It is a delightfully different world to the fashionable streets of Florence, Milan and Venice: little English is spoken; time is flexible; it has been little touched by tourism and surprises lurk around every corner. \_A trip to Puglia is a fascinating and rewarding experience, particularly in the spring."
