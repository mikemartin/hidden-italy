        text: "\_Based on several years’ research, this magnificent hike follows the same route, starting in Biella and finishing on Mt Moro on the Swiss border. \_It passes through some of the most spectacular scenery in the European Alps, staying in a mixture of hotels, pilgrim monasteries and mountain huts along the way.\_ Although we will walk through uncontaminated mountain landscapes, this is an ancient land: traders, pilgrims and graziers have been passing through here for millennia, in fact, since before the Bronze Age."
