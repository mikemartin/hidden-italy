        text: "The tour starts in beautiful Alba, 95 kilometres south of Turin.\_ A handsome town of Roman origin, Alba is the ‘capital’ of the Langhe, a close-knit range of hills and valleys which are crowded with impeccably tended rows of nebbiolo vines, the source of some of Italy’s finest wines.\_ They form a unique and striking landscape, so much so that the district was recently listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site, Italy’s 50th."

Located where the Po River plain meets the foothills of the Alps, Biella has long been a trade and commercial centre. The Oropa Valley has connected Italy to Switzerland and France since Roman times. Its centuries-old textile tradition continues today, producing high-quality wool and housing fashion brands like Ermenegildo Zegna. We'll have dinner at an innovative local restaurant."

        title: 'Hike to baroque monastery'
        description: "The path we take today leaves Biella, following a route first mentioned in 1207 that once served as a trade route to Lyon in central France. It climbs through forests and hamlets, offering spectacular views over the plains. We'll stop for a delicious picnic lunch. The hike ends at one of the most unexpected and striking sites on the walk: a vast baroque monastery that has been a popular pilgrimage destination for centuries and where we’ll stay the night."
