        text: "The Valley del Lys a long and narrow valley that starts at the glacier-covered slopes of Monte Rosa, the second highest mountain in the European Alps, and winds south following the course of the Lys River to the main Aosta Valley.\_ It is a narrow valley, its steep sides covered in pine and beech forests; and highland pastures scattered with tiny hamlets.\_ The valley was originally inhabited by the Walsers, a German-speaking people who migrated over the passes from Switzerland in the 13th century.\_ Even after eight centuries, German is still spoken, the traditions are still alive and the towns and villages of the valley are still characterised by their beautiful, timber architecture."
