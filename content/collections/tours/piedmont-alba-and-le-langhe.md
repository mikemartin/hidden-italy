        text: "The tour starts in beautiful Alba, 95 kilometres south of Turin.\_ A handsome town of Roman origin, Alba is the ‘capital’ of the Langhe, a close-knit range of hills and valleys which are crowded with impeccably tended rows of nebbiolo vines, the source of some of Italy’s finest wines.\_ They form a unique and striking landscape, so much so that the district was recently listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site, Italy’s 50th."
