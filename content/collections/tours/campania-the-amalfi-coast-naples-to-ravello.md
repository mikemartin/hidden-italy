        text: 'The Romans called the region around Naples ‘Campania Felix’ or the ‘happy lands’. With its rich history, spectacular coastline and fertile interior, Campania has much to be happy about: a stunningly beautiful area with endless surprises and all the exuberance and colour of southern Italy.'

        text: "\_Campania is a region of great variety: the excitement of Naples; active volcanoes; dis-entombed ancient cities; dramatic coastline; and bustling fishing islands contrast with the majesty and grace of its little-visited interior: forgotten palaces and monasteries; rolling hills draped in vineyards; soaring mountains covered in beech and chestnut forests; sleepy medieval villages where you won’t see another tourist for days.\_"
